The male and Female voice files were made with text to speech
on http://www.fromtexttospeech.com/  of all the voices they sounded the most human.

The DFPlayed can read most any MP3 so feel free to yous your own voices.

File names are not important since the player uses the file index on the SD's file system.

Setting up the SD card is important because the order you place the files and directories in the index.

1st make the empty folders
the order you make them will set the index.
  ie;
    folder0   would have index 0
	folder1
		playFolder(folderNumber, fileNumber);
		
2nd copy the files one by one to thier respectiv folders in the order of their index.
