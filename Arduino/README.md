# Fibonacci_ESP32 code
ESP32 Atomic Fibonacci Clock with Android App and full Daylight Savings Time(DST) support

The code is fairly strait forward
 I load settings from preferences and get GMT time.  the TimeZone code corrects for your time zone.

setting time is simple
connect to the clock (fibonacci.local) pick your timezone then the timezon rule for your area.
thats it time is set
